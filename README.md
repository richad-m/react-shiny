# React application

This is a react based application initialized with Create-react-app. I made this application to learn React along with a course on OpenClassRoom. 

I made it to learn about style (with styled-components), useState, useEffect and useContext. 

## Styled-Components

All the style of the application has been done using styled-components. It also uses a GlobalStyle.

The application is still in developpement.
