# React application

This is a react based application initialized with Create-react-app. I made this application to learn React along with a course on OpenClassRoom. 

I made it to learn about React, it uses : 

- React-router 
- State with useState
- UseEffect to call API
- Context with useContext
- Custom hooks (useFetch to fetch data from API)
- Styled-components to add CSS per component

## Styled-Components

All the style of the application has been done using styled-components. It also uses a GlobalStyle.

The application is still in developpement.
